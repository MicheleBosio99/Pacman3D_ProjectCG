# Idea for Pacman 3D Project

## Introduction
The project aims to create a 3D version of the classic arcade game Pacman.

## Features
- 3D Environment: The game will be set in a fully rendered 3D environment, allowing players to explore and navigate through a maze-like world.
- Pacman Character: The iconic Pacman character will be brought to life in 3D, complete with animations and sound effects.
- Ghost Enemies: The game will feature various ghost enemies that Pacman must avoid or defeat using power-ups.
- Power-ups: Power-ups will be scattered throughout the maze, providing Pacman with temporary abilities such as increased speed or invincibility.
- Score and Leaderboard: The game will keep track of the player's score and provide a leaderboard to encourage competition among players.

## Technologies
- Unity Game Engine: We will utilize the Unity game engine to develop the 3D environment, character animations, and gameplay mechanics.
- C# Programming Language: The game logic and scripting will be implemented using C# to interact with the Unity engine.
- 3D Modeling Software: We will use 3D modeling software such as Blender to create the game assets, including the Pacman character and ghost enemies.
